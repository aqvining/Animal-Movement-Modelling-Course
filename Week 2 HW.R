####Problem 1: Write a function, removePositive, that will take a vector or list as input and 
####           replaces all postitive values with 0's
####Note: When dealing with strings, you might find NAs are introduced by coercion. For now, it is okay
####      if your function produces this warning, so long as it is still able to produce the right answer
####Hint: the which() function may be helpful

####Problem 2: Write a function, reduce, that takes a numeric vector and does 3 things: If the range of values in the
####           vector is over 100, divide all values by 2. 2) If the previous reduction occured and any values are still greater
####           than 100 or less than -100, make them 100 or -100 respectively. 3) If there are more negative values than positive 
####           values, reverse the sign of all values (do this regardless of whether the previous two steps occurred). Finally,
####           return the new vector. If the vector is unchanged, print a message that says so.
####Hint:      Check out the range(), min(), and max() functions. Remember you can search for functions using ?
####Hint:      You can put if statments inside other if statements!
